Story:
Centuries ago, the Enchanted Glen was a prosperous forest, filled with mystical creatures and abundant resources
However, a powerful sorcerer cursed the land, causing the once-vibrant trees to wither, the rivers to dry up, and the wildlife to become twisted and malevolent
The curse attracted all sorts of unsavory characters to the glen, from bandits to necromancers seeking to tap into its dark energy
A group of animals, who were also affected by the curse, banded together to defend their home
Over time, they learned to communicate with each other in common tongue and formed a tribe known as the Speakkin
The Speakkin, being the only intelligent beings in the forest, have become protective of their land and the creatures within it
They now forbid outsiders from entering, with few exceptions made for those in genuine need of aid
Recently, reports have surfaced of a group of Dragons from neighboring forests planning to sweep through the glen and seize its power
The Speakkin have been mobilizing and have requested the aid of adventurers to help them fend off the Dragons
The adventurers soon discover the truth behind the Dragons' motive
The Speakkin had been keeping a powerful magical artifact hidden within the glen, and the Dragons have been sent to recover it for their lord
The artifact is revealed to be a cursed gemstone, capable of amplifying the sorcerer's curse on the forest
If the gemstone were to fall in the hands of the Dragons, the curse would spread beyond Enchanted Glen, causing devastating effects all over the realm
The adventurers must now race against time to secure the gemstone and prevent the Dragons from finding it, all while defending the Enchanted Glen from their attackers
In the end, the adventurers locate the gemstone, and a fierce battle ensues, resulting in the defeat of the Dragons
However, as the gemstone is being secured, the Speakkin leader suddenly lunges at it, revealing that they had been the ones who had the artifact all along
It turns out that the Speakkin had been keeping it hidden for a reason
The gemstone's curse was the only thing keeping the twisted creatures of the forest in check
Without it, the creatures would grow wild and unrestricted, making the forest even more dangerous
The adventurers are left to ponder what to do next
Whether they should return the gemstone and risk unleashing chaos on the realm or keep it guarded, securing the curse at the cost of the forest's original inhabitants
It is a difficult choice, but ultimately, the players must decide the fate of Enchanted Glen
